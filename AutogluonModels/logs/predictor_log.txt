AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.

train_data with frequency 'IRREG' has been resampled to frequency '15min'.
Provided train_data has 148549 rows (NaN fraction=0.9%), 6 time series. Median time series length is 27840 (min=11692, max=27859). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'Electricity(kW)'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        ['station_name']
		continuous (float): []

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MAE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
